### Patch Changes

- f1e7939: Finalize implementation of electric portion of API, add unit and functional tests.

  ***

  Water and Natural Gas theoretically function at least somewhat but have not been tested yet, nor can I on my own. My
  utility doesn't use AquaHawk for water monitoring, and I don't even have natural gas So, anyone who wants to use Water
  or Natural Gas, so I am literally unable to test those utility types with this API. If you do have Water and/or Natural
  Gas in your Utility/AquaHawk account, please submit a PR! If you can't do that, at least send me some sample data :)

  As well, this API assumes one meter and one account. This can and should also be changed in the future
